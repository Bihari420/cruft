**cruft** allows you to maintain all the necessary boilerplate for packaging and building projects separate from the code you intentionally write.
Fully compatible with existing [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) templates.

Creating new projects from templates using cruft is easy:

And, so is updating them as the template changes overtime:

Many project template utilities exist that automate the copying and pasting of code to create new projects. This *seems* great! However, once created, most leave you with that copy-and-pasted code to manage through the life of your project.

**cruft** is different. It automates the creation of new projects like the others, but then it also helps you to manage the boilerplate through the life of the project. **cruft** makes sure your code stays in-sync with the template it came from for you.
